## General info

Quantum Optics simulations using the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming lenguage with the frameworks [QuantumOptics.jl](https://qojulia.org/) 
and [Plots.jl](http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/).

## Technologies
All material in this project is created with:
* Julia v1.5.3
* QuantumOptics.jl 
* Plots.jl

## Setup
To run some script you need install Julia first. Glance at the [julia doc](https://julialang.org/downloads/) to install it. Then you can open your console and type:

```
$ julia my-script.jl
```

Alternatively you can open the julia shell with the command: `julia` and then include your jl file with the `include` function: 

```
$ julia
```
```
julia> include('my-script.jl')

```

## Contributing
Please feel free to contribute by adding your own scripts.
